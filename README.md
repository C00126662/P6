## Problems

I had trouble incorporating the enemy model I downloaded with the navmesh and navmesh agent components in the scene. The enemies did not respond correctly so I had to remove the component.

In the demo I presented in class, the WinPortal did not function properly, by loading the WinScene. It does however work properly in the editor, so it must have been a problem introduced during the build process.

## Notes

After the presentations, I added a ParticleSystem to my BulletEmitter and it functions properly.

Other than that, everything works well and I believe I hit every other requirement.
