# Project 6 (Final)
 The Fruit Hunter by Robert Dooley (C00126662)

## Problems

I had trouble incorporating the enemy model I downloaded with the navmesh and navmesh agent components in the scene. The enemies did not respond correctly so I had to remove the component.

In the demo I presented in class, the WinPortal did not function properly, by loading the WinScene. It does however work properly in the editor, so it must have been a problem introduced during the build process.

There was an issue in the final build where the invincibility sporadically didn't work, but it does work in the editor.

## Post-Presentation Updates

After the presentations, I added a ParticleSystem to my BulletEmitter and it functions properly.

I corrected some of the issues in my 3rdPersonGameScene relating to missing objects, and other miscellaneous little details.

I included a OneDrive link txt file to my project's game files in this repo. I could not upload it the game files directly because GitHub said the file size was too large. After class today I was told the OneDrive method was acceptable.
